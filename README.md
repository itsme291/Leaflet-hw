This assignment uses USGS earthquake data for all earthquakes for past 7 days and builds visualization for the same. 

Users have options to look at the data through 4 base map options:
- Light Map
- Dark Map
- Satellite
- Outdoor

Users have following options to choose from:
- Earthquake locations: Size and color of the markers correspond to the magnitude
- Heatmap: Highlights heatmap depicting number of earthquakes in an area

Additionally, a second data set is used to depict fault lines.

Not surprisingly, most of the earthquakes and biggest magnitude earthquakes occur along the faultlines.
